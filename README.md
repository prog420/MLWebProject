## MLWebProject
<ins>Reactions Prediction based on Transformer models</ins> <br/>
Project deployed at [PythonAnywhere](http://dmitrybv.pythonanywhere.com/) <br>
Transformer models deployed at [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com) <br>
Server-side Framework: **Flask** <br><br>
Two pretrained models are available at this moment:
1. SMILES to SMILES
2. SMILES to CGR

<br>Additional Features:
- 2D representation for SMILES and CGR sequences (based on [CGRtools](https://github.com/stsouko/CGRtools) depiction tools);
- CGR Decomposition to Reactants and Products;
- Beam Width Selector (Available values: 1, 3, 5);
- IUPAC name to SMILES Converter;
- Translator from RU/FR/DE to English IUPAC compound names.
